This is v0.6.3 of icrawler slightly modified for lazylibrarian.
There is a new regex for google that had not been merged into master at the time, see
https://github.com/hellock/icrawler/pull/74/files 
bs4 parsing has been changed from lxml to html5lib as we already have that installed 
in lazylibrarian, and we try to use relative imports for bs4 and requests as some nas 
units do not have system-wide versions available
